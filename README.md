# wr-python-package-tutorial

If you are developing your own application, creating your own modules and packages will help you organize and modularize your code, which makes coding, maintenance, and debugging easier.

This tutoiral walks you through how to package a simple Python project. It will show you how to add the necessary files and structure to create the package, how to build the package, and how to upload it to the Python Package Index.

## Setups

First of all, clone this repository to your local host:
```
git clone https://github.com/idalab-de/wr-python-package-tutorial.git 
cd wr-python-package-tutorial
```

You may want to install the following packages which we'll use later:
```
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel twine
```

To be able to upload the package into the index, you’ll need to register an account on Test PyPI. To register an account, go to https://test.pypi.org/account/register/ and complete the steps on that page. You will also need to verify your email address before you’re able to upload any packages.
